## Who Is Sport Psychology For?

Sports psychology is for elite athletes, weekend warriors, and anyone who wants to move their body more effectively. The field is often associated with professionals who help Olympic and professional athletes win in highly competitive settings, but that's not all they do.

The tactics they use to help elite performers excel can also be utilized in recreational settings to help people enjoy sports, handle anxiety, and build motivation. Techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, hypnosis, and CBT can improve relaxation and concentration.

## Understanding Sports Psychology

Sports psychology studies how psychological factors influence sports, athletic performance, exercise, and physical activity. Sports psychologists investigate how participating in sports can improve health and well-being. They also help athletes utilize psychology to improve their athletic performance and mental wellness.

For example, sports psychologists worked with elite basketball pros like Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, and Kobe Bryant to help them perform better on the basketball court. By teaching them psychological techniques for "being in the flow" and getting in "the zone," they were able to hone their focus and athletic resilience.

A sports psychologist doesn't just work with elite and professional athletes either. This type of professional also helps non-athletes and everyday exercisers learn how to enjoy sports and stick to an exercise program.

They utilize exercise and athletics to enhance people's lives and mental well-being.

## History of Sports Psychology

Sports psychology is a relatively young discipline in psychology; the first research lab devoted to the topic opened in 1925. The first U.S. lab closed a short while later (in the early 1930s) and American research did not resume in this area until the late 1960s when there was a revival of interest.

In 1965, the International Society of Sport Psychology (ISSP) was established. By the 1970s, sports psychology had been introduced as a university course offered at educational institutions throughout North America.

By the 1980s, sports psychology became the subject of a more rigorous scientific focus. Researchers began to explore how psychology could be used to improve athletic performance. They also looked at how exercise could be utilized to improve mood and lower stress levels.

## Different Types of Sports Psychologists

Just as there are different types of psychologists—such as clinical psychologists, developmental psychologists, and forensic psychologists—there are also different types of sports psychologists.

### Educational Sports Psychologists

An educational sports psychologist uses psychological methods to help athletes improve sports performance. This includes teaching them how to use certain techniques such as imagery, goal setting, or self talk to perform better on the court or field.

### Clinical Sports Psychologists

Clinical sports psychologists work with athletes who have mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety. This work involves using strategies from both sports psychology and psychotherapy.

A clinical sports psychologist helps athletes improve their mental health and sports performance at the same time.

### Exercise Psychologists

An exercise psychologist works with non-athlete clients or everyday exercisers to help them learn how to make working out a habit. This work can include some of the same techniques used by other sports psychologists, such as goal setting, practicing mindfulness, and the use of motivational techniques.

## Uses for Sports Psychology

Contemporary sports psychology is a diverse field and there are a number of different topics that are of special interest to sports psychologists. Here are a few areas of sports psychology and how they are utilized.

### Attentional Focus

Attentional focus involves the ability to tune out distractions (such as a crowd of screaming fans) and focus on the task at hand. This allows athletes to manage their mental focus, even in the face of other things that are vying for their attention.

Common strategies that might be used for this purpose include deep breathing, paying attention to bodily signals and sensations, and mindfulness. All of these can help athletes stay focused on the present moment.

### Mental Toughness

Mental toughness has become an area of increasing interest in sports psychology. The term refers to the psychological characteristics that are important for an athlete to reach optimal performance.

Among these characteristics are having an unshakeable belief in one's self, the ability to bounce back from setbacks, and an insatiable desire to succeed. Reacting to situations positively, remaining calm under pressure, and retaining control are a few others that contribute to mental toughness.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Sports psychology offers athletes many benefits, from improved performance to a healthier mental recovery after sustaining a physical injury.

**What can you do with a sports psychology degree?**  
Sports psychologists can take a few different career paths. If you want to teach athletes how to improve their performance through psychological techniques, you can do this as an educational sports psychologist. If you want to work with athletes who have a mental illness, a clinical sports psychologist offers this service. If you want to work with the everyday exerciser versus athletes, becoming an exercise psychologist might be a good career choice for you.

**How can sports psychology improve performance?**  
In some cases, sports psychology improves performance by reducing anxiety. In others, it works by improving focus or increasing mental toughness. A sports psychologist can help uncover issues that might be limiting the athlete's performance. This information is then used to determine which psychological techniques can offer the best results.
