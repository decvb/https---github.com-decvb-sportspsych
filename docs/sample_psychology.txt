Hey there! Let’s talk about staying focused when you’re playing sports. 

Everyone gets distracted sometimes—maybe you’re thinking about a mistake you made, or you’re worried about what your coach will say. That’s totally normal! The trick is to bring your attention back to what’s happening right now, not what happened before or what might happen next.

One thing you can try is a quick reset routine. For example, if you’re playing tennis and you lose a point, take a deep breath, bounce the ball a couple of times, and remind yourself, “Next point, fresh start.”

Another tip: set small, simple goals for yourself during practice or games. Instead of thinking, “I have to win,” try, “I’m going to focus on my footwork for the next five minutes.”

And remember, mistakes are part of the game. Even the pros mess up! The important thing is how you respond. Be kind to yourself, shake it off, and get ready for the next play.

If you ever feel stuck or nervous, talk to a teammate or coach. You’re not alone—everyone feels pressure sometimes. The more you practice these mental skills, the easier they get.

You’ve got this! Let’s keep it fun and keep learning every time you play.
